<h1> UQU </h1>
<h2> introduction </h2> 
<p> Umm Al-Qura University (UQU; Arabic: جامعة أم القرى Jāmiʿah ʾUmm Al-Qurā) is a public university in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The university was established as the College of Sharia (Islamic Law) in 1949 before being joined by new colleges and renamed as Umm Al-Qura by royal decree in 1981.[1] </p>

<h2> History </h2>
<p> The College of Da'wa 'Islamic Call' and Fundamentals of Religion was established on 21/12/1401 A.H (20 October 1981) by the Royal Decree No. 27278/32/3. This college is considered as an extension of the two ancient colleges; College of Shari`ah and Islamic Studies and College of Education. It was renamed into "the College of Da'wa and Usul-ud-Din" which means "College of Islamic Call and Fundamentals of Religion".[2]

By the beginning of the academic year 1402/1403 A.H (1982-1983), the College started to offer courses and it included four departments for both male and female students, However, by the academic year 1404/1405 A.H (1984-1985), the Department of the Qur'an and Sunna was inaugurated by virtue of resolution No. 30/4/16/6827/1, issued on 22/07/1404 A.H (23 April 1984), according to the resolution of university's high council during its second session dated 25/06/1404 A.H (28 March 1984), which required moving the Department of the Qur'an and Sunna from the College of Shari`ah (Islamic Law) to the College of Da'wa and Usul-ud-Din (Call to Islam and Religion's Fundamentals). </p>
